    "## 1.1. Bisecting K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means often results in clusters of widely different sizes. In this assessment you are asked to implement an extension to k-means called bisecting k-means. The algorithm proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a cluster to split (for this exercise, always pick the largest one)\n",
    "2. Find 2 sub-clusters using the basic k-means algorithm (bisecting step)\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 for ITER times (for this exercise, set ITER=20) and take the split that minimizes the inertia\n",
    "4. Repeat steps 1, 2 and 3 until the desired number of clusters is reached\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement the bisecting k-means algorithm.\n",
    "2. Apply bisecting k-means to the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set using the first 10 numerical features in the dataset as feature vectors (as was done in the practical exercise \"Exercise 7 - PCA\"). Remember to scale the data to have zero mean and unit variance before clustering. Run the algorithm three different times so that the data are divided into: (a) 2 clusters, (b) 5 clusters, (c) 10 clusters.\n",
    "3. Compare the number of observations in each cluster between basic k-means and bisecting k-means when the data are divided into 10 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Aims:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gain a better understanding of k-means and clustering algorithms in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3. Tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to use any function that was used in the practical exercises."
